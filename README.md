Project Title: DATASPARK: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics

Project Overview: DataSpark is a comprehensive analytics project focused on the retail sector of the global electronics industry. The primary goal of this project is to harness data to uncover valuable insights that can drive business decisions, optimize operations, and enhance customer experiences.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
This phase involves gathering raw data from various sources, such as sales,customer,product,excange,store . The data is then cleaned to remove inaccuracies, duplicates, and irrelevant information, ensuring that the dataset is reliable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is conducted to explore the data visually and statistically. This step helps identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data. Techniques such as data visualization and summary statistics are employed to gain a deeper understanding of sales performance, customer preferences and popular products.

Data Visualization with Power BI/Tableau:
The insights derived from the analysis are presented using data visualization tools like Power BI . These tools help create interactive dashboards and reports that make it easy for stakeholders to understand complex data and make informed decisions.

Skills Gained: Through this project, participants will enhance their skills in data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, Python programming  and data visualization using tools like Power BI.
